# First Deployment

*In this section, we'll create our first deployment.*

**We're nearly there!**

We're up to deploying our project for the first time!

This is going to be a bit complicated at first, but the work we do here will make every other deployment much simplier. 

You'll remember way back when we were [testing locally](00-test-local.md) we built two images: a `web` image and a `db` image. 

`db` will be replaced with the proper postgres database we've [already setup](20-setup-sql.md). 

So we just need to build the other image!

For that, we'll be using Cloud Build. This is a similar process to `docker build .`, but this will build the image on Google Cloud itself, and publish the image to the Google Cloud image repository, `gcr.io`. 

To build the image:

```shell
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/unicodex .
```

Then, we can (finally!) create our Cloud Run service using this image. We'll also tell it all about the database we setup earlier, and all those secrets: 

```
gcloud beta run deploy unicodex \
    --allow-unauthenticated \
    --region us-central1 \
    --image gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/unicodex \
    --update-env-vars DATABASE_URL=berglas://${BERGLAS_BUCKET}/database_url,SECRET_KEY=berglas://${BERGLAS_BUCKET}/secret_key,GS_BUCKET_NAME=berglas://${BERGLAS_BUCKET}/media_bucket \
    --add-cloudsql-instances $DATABASE_INSTANCE
```

*Note:* Cloud Run is still in beta at the time of writing. There may be additional options you have to set here. Best bet is to choose the default that is offered. 

Sadly, we have a few more steps. Even though we have deployed our service, **Django won't work yet**. Because: 

* We need to tell Django where to expect our service to run, and 
* we need to initalise our database.

#### Service URL, and `ALLOWED_HOSTS` 

We can either copy the URL from the output we got from the last step, or we can get it from `gcloud`

```
gcloud beta run services list
```

We could copy the URL from this output, or we can use [`--format` and `--filter`](https://dev.to/googlecloud/giving-format-to-your-gcloud-output-57gm) parameters:

```shell
export SERVICE_URL=$(gcloud beta run services list \
	--format="value(status.url)" \
	--filter="metadata.name=unicodex")
	 
echo $SERVICE_URL
```

Then, we can redeploy our service, updating *just* this new environment variable: 

```
gcloud beta run services update unicodex \
	--update-env-vars CURRENT_HOST=$SERVICE_URL
```

In this case, `CURRENT_HOST` is setup in our [setup.py](../setup.py) to be added to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, if defined. 


**Important**: `ALLOWED_HOSTS` takes a hostname without a scheme (i.e. without the leading 'https'). Our `settings.py` handles this by removing it, if it appears. 

#### Initialising Database

Our database currently has no schema or data, so we're going to have to do this, too. 

Back in our [local testing](00-test-local.md), we did this by executing `migrate`, `loaddata` and `automatesuperuser` from the command line. 

The problem is, we don't have a command-line. 

Well, we do, we have Cloud Shell, but that's not really *automatible*. We don't want to have to log into the console every time we have to run a migration. We *could*, and this is a valid option if your setup requires/demands it, but we're going to take the time now to automate migration and deployment. 

We're going to use [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/), running manually for now, but automating it in the next step. We'll make it perform our database migrations, as well as build our image, and deploy our service. 

To start with, we need to give Cloud Build permission to access our database, and invoke Cloud Run. 

This code is similar to the `add-iam-policy-binding` code we used to [setup berglas](40-setup-secrets.md): 

```
export PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe ${PROJECT_ID} --format 'value(projectNumber)')
export SA_CB_EMAIL=${PROJECT_NUMBER}@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
	--member serviceAccount:${SA_CB_EMAIL} \
	--role roles/cloudsql.client \
	--role roles/run.admin \
	--role roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
```

You can check the current roles by:

* running `gcloud projects get-iam-policy $PROJECT_ID`, or 
* going to the [IAM & Admin](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam) page in the console. 

From here, we can then run our `gcloud builds submit` command again, but with new parameters: 

```
gcloud builds submit --config .cloudbuild/build-migrate-deploy.yaml \
    --substitutions="_IMAGE=unicodex,_DATABASE_INSTANCE=${DATABASE_INSTANCE},_SERVICE=unicodex"
```

As suggested by the filename, this will perform three tasks for us: 

* Build the image (like we were doing before, 
* Apply the database migrations, and
* Deploy the service with the new image. 

But additionally: 

* it uses Berglas to pull the secrets we stored earlier to create a local `.env` file
* using that `.env`, runs the django management commands: 
  * `./manage.py migrate`, which applies our database migrations
  * `./manage.py collectstatic`, which uploads our local static files to the media bucket
* it also, if there's no existing superuser, create a superuser. 


The full contents of the script is in [.cloudbuild/build-migrate-deploy.yaml](../.cloudbuild/build-migrate-deploy.yaml). 


Noted custom configurations: 

* We use `gcr.io/google-appengine/exec-wrapper` as an easier way to setup a Cloud SQL proxy. 
* We make own `.env` file using the ability for berglas to store a secret in a file (via `?destination`). This is because [Cloud Build envvars don't persist through steps](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/berglas/tree/master/examples/cloudbuild)
* We throw all our asks in one giant honking `.yaml`, because then we only need to call one `submit` command. 

We are also running this command with [substitutions](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/configuring-builds/substitute-variable-values#using_user-defined_substitutions). These allow us to change the image, service, and database instance (which will be helpful later on when we define multiple environments). You can hardcode these yourself by commenting out the `substutitions:` stanza in the yaml file.

And now. 

Finally. 

You can see the working website!

Go to the `SERVICE_URL` in your browser, and gaze upon all you created. 

You did it! üèÜ

You can also log in with the `superuser`/`superpass`, and run the admin action as in [step 0](00-test-local.md).

After all this work, each future deployment is exceedindly less complex.
