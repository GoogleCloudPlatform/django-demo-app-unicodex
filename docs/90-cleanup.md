# Clean up

If you no longer want to keep your application running, you need to clean it up. 

If you chose to create a new Google Cloud Platform project just for this app, then you can cleanup by deleting the entire project. 


To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud Platform account for the resources used in this tutorial:
 * In the Cloud Console, go to the [Manage resources](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager) page.
 * In the project list, select your project then click Delete.
 * In the dialog, type the project ID and then click Shut down to delete the project.

#### ⚠️ Please cleanup after yourself ⚠️

Some of the resources created in this documentation have an ongoing cost. If you no longer want to run this application, it's a really good idea to destroy the resources so you are not charged. 

The most significant part of this tutorial is the Cloud SQL database, which has an ongoing cost (of the suggested settings) of around $10USD per month. Other components could have ongoing costs, depending on their usage.
