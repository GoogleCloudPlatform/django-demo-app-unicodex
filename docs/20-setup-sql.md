# Create a Cloud SQL Instance

*In this section we will be creating a database instance, database, and user, and come away with our `DATABASE_URL`*

To store our application data, we'll need to setup a postgres [Cloud SQL](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances) instance, and a specific database with a database user.

This part of the tutorial is a bit longer, so we'll have section headers :)

### Database Instance

The database instance creation process has many configuration options, but a lot of good defaults, so we're going to follow the [Create a Cloud SQL instance](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/quickstart#create-instance) section of the "Quickstart for Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL" tutorial (rather than running a CLI command.)

Important notes: 

* The default configurations may work for you, but be sure to check if there's anything you want to change.
* Make sure you make note of the "Default User Password". We'll refer to this as `MASTER_PASSWORD`.
* The instance creation may take **several minutes.** 

We can confirm we've correctly setup this database for our project by checking for it in `gcloud`: 

```
gcloud sql instances list
```

Make note of the "NAME", which we will call `INSTANCE_NAME`, to avoid confusion later. We will also use the "LOCATION" later as our `REGION`.

```
export INSTANCE_NAME=YourinstanceName
export REGION=us-central1 # probably. 
```
Note, the region we need may be listed as, for example, "us-central1-a", but we don't require the zone ("a"). 

### Our Database 

Our database **instance** can hold many **databases**. For our purposes, we're going to setup a `unicodex` database: 

```
gcloud sql databases create unicodex --instance=$INSTANCE_NAME
```

And then, the user for this database. 

Since by default [users created using Cloud SQL have the privileges associated with the `cloudsqlsuperuser` role](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/create-manage-users#creating), and we don't want our django user to have such permissions, we'll have to move to the Cloud Shell for the next part.

**A note on Cloud Shell**

To help with the ease of setting up our databases, we'll be moving away form our local terminal and using the [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/quickstart) for part of this tutorial. Cloud Shell is an environment to help us work with managing resources hosted on Google Cloud. 

We *could* run the entire tutorial locally, that would require setting up  the [Cloud SQL Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/sql-proxy), and other configurations. Since we don't need to be here for long, we'll use the Cloud Shell. 

To help, we've prefixed all the Cloud Shell commands in this section with "‚òÅÔ∏è" to remind you this is for Cloud Shell.

---

Go to the [Cloud SQL Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances) and select the instance you just created. 

Click on 'Connect using Cloud Shell', and you'll be provisioned a Cloud Shell machine, and a tab at the bottom of your browser will show the console. 

It should also pre-populate with the command you need: 

```
‚òÅÔ∏è gcloud sql connect $INSTANCE_NAME --user=postgres --quiet
```

You'll be asked for your `MASTER_PASSWORD` that we set earlier. 

We will then be within the **postgres** terminal. This is yet another terminal. We won't be too long. 

We can then create our django user: 

```
CREATE USER django WITH PASSWORD 'secret_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO django;
```
In this case, we are using the `USERNAME` "django" and the `PASSWORD` "secret_password". Of course, you will **use a much more secure password**.

We can now exit the postgres terminal, and leave the Cloud Shell. 

---

We now have all the elements we need to create our `DATABASE_URL`. This is a format defined in a lot of systems, including [`django-environ`](https://django-environ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

Back in our **local terminal** (hello old friend!), we will need the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` for the `DATABASE_NAME` on the `INSTANCE_NAME` we created, in whatever `REGION` to form the `DATABASE_URL`:

```shell
export USERNAME=django
export PASSWORD=secret_password
export DATABASE_NAME=unicodex

export DATABASE_URL=postgres://$USERNAME:${PASSWORD}@//cloudsql/$PROJECT_ID:$REGION:$INSTANCE_NAME/$DATABASE_NAME
```

For convenience, later we will also need a smaller version of this string, which just our absolute Cloud SQL Instance identifer: 

```shell
export DATABASE_INSTANCE=$PROJECT_ID:$REGION:$INSTANCE_NAME
```

We now have the environment variables we need! üç™
